Hello, My name is  `REDACTED`.  But I mainly go online as "Little Cat".  If you want to reach out to me, I'm mainly active on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LittleToonCat).

I currently work as a Lead Developer of [Toontown Offline](https://ttoffline.com), and as a Game Developer at [Toontown: Corporate Clash](https://corporateclash.net).

I have been working on Toontown for the past 6 or so years, and still going strong!  I have worked/contributed in the following (in order):

* Toontown Revolution [2013-2014] *(ugh)*
* Toontown House/Next [2014 - 2015]
* Toontown Fellowship (Part Time) [2015]
* Toontown Infinite (2nd incarnation) [2016]
* Toontastic Time Turner (Unreleased) [2016]
* Toontown Infinite (3rd incarnation) [2016-2017]
* [Toontown Archive](https://toontownarchive.com/) [2016-Present]
* [Toontown Offline](https://ttoffline.com) [2017-Present]
* [Toontown: Corporate Clash](https://corporateclash.net) [2019-Present]

I also have an high interest in video games (retro and new), obscure technology, and networking as well.  I use Linux (Ubuntu) as my main OS since 2015.  It's a much happiler place than using Windows, mainly for software development.
